# PiBot-JLR
Discord bot that leverages JLRPY lib to communicate with Jaguar I-Pace

Basically just a fun little project to familiarize myself with using python, in this project i will be using an unofficial python library made by github user Ardevd (https://github.com/ardevd/jlrpy/blob/master/README.md) and a discord bot running on my raspberry pi 4 to interact with my Jaguar I-Pace 2019 model.

Current version only supports the keyword "info" which informs the bot retrieve and print information about the car:
* Color
* Model
etc.

Features i'm working on implementing are:
* Getting the bot to find current location of the vehicle
* Get last 5-10 trips
* Lock and unluck
* honk the horn
etc.
